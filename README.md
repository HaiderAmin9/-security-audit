# Project: Security Conduct

## Overview

In this project, titled **"Security Conduct,"** I conducted an internal security audit for Botium Toys as part of my Google Cybersecurity Certification. The audit aimed to evaluate the internal security measures, identify vulnerabilities, and ensure compliance with security policies.

## Scope and Goals

### Scope
The scope of this audit encompasses the entire security program at Botium Toys. This includes their assets, such as employee equipment and devices, internal network, and systems. The audit involved reviewing these assets and evaluating the controls and compliance practices in place.

### Goals
- Assess existing assets and complete the controls and compliance checklist.
- Identify which controls and compliance best practices need to be implemented to enhance Botium Toys’ security posture.

### Current Assets
- On-premises equipment for in-office business needs.
- Employee equipment: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones), remote workstations, and peripherals (headsets, cables, keyboards, etc.).
- Storefront products for retail sale, both on-site and online.
- Systems, software, and services management: accounting, telecommunication, database, security, e-commerce, and inventory management.
- Internet access, internal network, data retention and storage.
- Legacy system maintenance: end-of-life systems requiring human monitoring.

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Description
Inadequate asset management and incomplete controls may lead to non-compliance with U.S. and international regulations and standards.

### Control Best Practices
Botium Toys needs to identify and classify assets, assess their impact on business continuity, and implement the NIST CSF Identify function.

### Risk Score
**8/10 – High risk** due to insufficient controls and non-compliance with best practices.

### Additional Comments
- Inadequate encryption and access controls.
- Lack of IDS, disaster recovery plans, and backups.
- Nominal password policy and no centralized password management system.
- Insufficient monitoring and maintenance of legacy systems.
